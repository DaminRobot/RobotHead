1.In this task I used Arduino Nano RP2040, Raspberry pi 4, Unipolar Stepper Motor A2K-S544, Driver MD5-HD14 and 2 EE-Sx762A Photo Micro Sensors.Stepper motor driver's CW+ and CCW+ pins connected to Arduino nano rp2040 digital pin 5 and 6 respectively, while CW- and CCW- pins connected to the ground. Also two photo microsensors are connected to digital pin 11 (RIGHT_SENSOR_PIN) and 10 (LEFT_SENSOR_PIN) for the right and left sensor pin respectively. Arduino receives serial commands from raspberry pi, and the commands are, 'C','D', 'R', 'S','I'. 

2.Whenever 'C' command is received, motor has to rotate 90 degrees in a clockwise CW direction, but if the right sensor RIGHT_SENSOR_PIN  is interrupted even before the 90 is reached then motor has to stop for a second, slowly rotate 8 degrees in a counter clockwise  CCW direction and stop then send Serial.println the rotation direction and the angle.
3.Whenever 'D' command is received, motor has to rotate 90 degrees in a counter clockwise CCW direction, but if the right sensor LEFT_SENSOR_PIN  is interrupted even before the 90 is reached then motor has to slowly rotate 8 degrees in a counter clockwise  CW direction and stop then then send Serial.println the rotation direction and the angle.

4. Whever the 'R' command (Reset) is received, program checks whether RIGHT_SENSOR_PIN is HIGH or LOW, while digitalRead(RIGHT_SENSOR_PIN) == HIGH) rotate the motor in a counter clockwise CCW direction until the right sensor is interrupted, if the right sensor is interrupted ie (digitalRead(RIGHT_SENSOR_PIN) == LOW)) rotate the motor 188 degrees Clockwise CW direction and stop and send Serial.println 'Home Base', but if it rotates too much that the left sensor is interrupted 'digitalRead(LEFT_SENSOR_PIN) == LOW)', slowly rotate the motor 8 degrees away from the sensor in CCW direction and then stop and send Serial.println 'Home Base'
5.Since 'C'/'D' and 'R' commands both use RIGHT_SENSOR_PIN and LEFT_SENSOR_PIN, there might be a conflict between the commands, I used flags to differentiate the sensor interruption for ('C' or'D') and ('R') command. Since the program is for the robot head, so the movement has to be between the right sensor and the left sensor, because robot head can not rotate more than 180 degrees, wires inside will be tingled.
6.When 'R' reset command is being executed and 'S' command is received, reset should be interrupted and motor has to stop immediately, then send Serial.println 'Motor Stopped'.
7. When 'I' info command is received, program checks whether robot is moving or stopped, if moving then it sends Serial.println 'Rotating' in CW or CCW direction, if stopped then it checks whether it is stopped at the Home Base or not, then it sends a Serial.println 'Stopped: Home Base', or 'Stopped: Not Home Base'.
8.Whenver the left sensor or right sensor is interrupted, Motor Stops for 3 seconds and then rotates 8 degrees in opposite direction direction, then stops and send a Serial.println 'Home Base'. In calculating the angle of rotation for both 'C'
 or 'D' and 'R'commands, I used a for-loop with the equation steps = angleDegrees / 0.72;
